# Species-level generalism

The scripts here were used to [explore](sp_level_exploratory.Rmd) and then analyze two metrics of parasite generalism, [host range](sp_level_analysis_host_range_freq.md) and [host taxonomic dissimilarity](sp_level_analysis_tax_dissim_freq.md). I also compared taxonomic and phylogenetic regressions [here](sp_level_compareTax_Phylo.md).
