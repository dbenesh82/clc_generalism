# Stage-level generalism

The scripts here were used to [explore](stage_level_comps_prelim.Rmd) and then analyze two metrics of parasite generalism, [host range](stage_level_analysis_host_range_freq.md) and [host taxonomic dissimilarity](stage_level_analysis_tax_dissim_freq.md). I also compared taxonomic and phylogenetic regressions [here](stage_level_compareTax_Phylo.md).
