      <b>E. Abstract</b>: This data set presents a food web for the Flensburg Fjord, a brackish shallow water inlet on the Baltic Sea, between Germany and Denmark. The system has a benthic and shallow water pelagic component. This food web has two noteworthy attributes: (1) inclusion of metazoan parasites and other infectious agents and (2) inclusion of ontogenetic stages of parasites with complex life cycles. Data on the free-living assemblages and parasitism were gathered during original field sampling and supplemented with information from additional published sources and local expert knowledge. Taxonomic resolution is generally high, although some functional or taxonomic groups (e.g., phytoplankton, macroalgae, and several groups of birds) are lumped into single nodes. Each ontogenetic stage of parasites with complex life cycles is treated separately and coded accordingly. For each node, we have included additional information such as taxonomy, life history, residency, and seasonality. Further, for each link, we define a specific interaction type. The web contains 180 nodes, 123 species/assemblages, and 1577 realized links. Of the 123 species/assemblages, 6 are basal, 70 are free-living, and 45 are infectious. We present the data and metadata in the system-neutral format standardized by R. F. Hechinger and colleagues, and thus recognize variables that are not represented in our data set but may be added by further study.

      <b>A. Overall project description</b>: Not applicable, as this is a stand-alone project.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>B. Research motivation</b>: Most data for this food web were originally compiled as part of a PhD project between 1998 and 2000 for a different purpose. At a later stage these data, in addition to literature sources and local expert knowledge, were used to construct a food web of the system which was integrated in the framework of the Parasites and Food Webs Working Group supported by the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS). Recent studies examining the role of parasites in similar estuarine systems (Hechinger et al. 2011) have found that parasites can dramatically influence properties such as food web structure (Lafferty et al. 2006a, Lafferty et al. 2006b) and ecosystem energetics (Kuris et al. 2008). To further the study of the infectious agents in ecosystems (Lafferty et al. 2008) we have assembled a food web for a similar system but without any species overlap with the food webs assembled for estuaries of the West coast of California and Baja California (Hechinger et al. 2011). To facilitate the use of this data and its incorporation by other researchers we have taken care to provide metadata for all our data columns and descriptors.

		<b>C.1. System definition</b>
	</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>
			<b>C.1.i. Description</b>: The Flensburg Fjord is a 50 km inlet of the Baltic Sea.  The Fjord forms part of the border between Denmark to the North and Germany to the South.  Salinity fluctuates between 11 and 20‰. The bottom of the fjord is generally bare mud or sand, but some areas are overgrown with algae (<i>Fucus vesiculosus</i>) in the littoral or algae (<i>Ceramium rubrum</i>) and seagrass (<i>Zostera marina</i>) in the sublittoral. Tides are marginal with an approximate amplitude of 10&ndash;20 cm, but fluctuations of water level caused by storms are more important. Temperature during the study ranged from a maximum of 23°C to a minimum (excluding the winter seasons) of 6°C. The following is a map of Flensburg:

		<b>C.2. Nodes</b>
	</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>
			<b>C.2.i. Orientation</b>: Nodes for the food web are listed in the Nodes data files. Two metadata tables describe the Nodes data files. <a href="Table2A.htm">Table 2A</a> defines node data column headers. <a href="Table2B.htm">Table 2B</a> defines node data column variables. Below, we provide additional background information on the nodes.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>C.2.ii. Node inclusion</b>: Data on the composition of the free-living and parasite fauna were gathered close to Bokholmwik between 1998 and 2000 by taking samples from the littoral (surface) and sublittoral (2.5&ndash;3m) every month, except during winter. Fish and benthic fauna were sampled using hand nets during SCUBA diving. Plankton samples were obtained by pouring 100 L through a sieve of 150 µg mesh size. Parasites were identified after dissection of the hosts using morphological characters. For details see Josten et al. (2009).
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>C.2.iii. Node resolution</b>: The “Node Resolution” column in the node data files indicates the degree of resolution for each node. While most of the nodes are species, or species-specific stages some functional or taxonomic groups (e.g. phytoplankton, macroalgae, different groups of birds) are aggregated into single nodes. The “Node Type” column is descriptive of the kind of resolution attributed to each node. Finally, as indicated by their discrete number codes and working names all nodes are mutually exclusive.
		</p>
		<p>
			In addition to providing a unique working name for each node, and indicating the general “Organismal Group” to which each node belongs, the data sets also include a series of columns for the taxonomic hierarchy (i.e., Kingdom through Specific epithet). This is primarily to aid users in understanding node identity and to facilitate taxonomic diversity analyses, versus the adoption of any particular taxonomic scheme.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>C.2.iv. Additional node classifications</b>: To facilitate analyses and interpretation, we have additionally classified nodes by several different schemes. The node metadata tables list and define all such categories and variables (<a href="Table2A.htm">Tables 2A</a>, <a href="Table2B.htm">2B</a>). For example, we indicate each node’s “Feeding type” (feeding, non-feeding, autotrophic), “Lifestyle” (e.g., free-living, infectious, commensal), “Consumer Strategy” (e.g., predator, macroparasite, pathogen, detritivore), and “Native” or non-native status. Additionally, the columns “Mobility” and “Residency” indicate for each node the general degree of vagility characterizing individuals on daily and seasonal time scales.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>C.2.v. Node biomass estimation</b>: We do not estimate the biomass of each node.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>C.2.vi. Node body size estimation</b>: We do not estimate the body size of each node.
		</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>
		<b>C.3. Links</b>
	</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>
			<b>C.3.i. Link orientation</b>: Consumer-resource links for the food web are listed in the links data files. Two metadata tables describe the links data files. <a href="Table3A.htm">Table 3A</a> defines all column headers. <a href="Table3B.htm">Table 3B</a> defines all column variables, except for the Link Types, which are indicated in <a href="Table3C.htm">Table 3C</a>. Below, we provide additional background information.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>C.3.ii. Link determination</b>: Trophic interactions for free-living species as well as parasites were obtained during original field sampling and supplemented with literature sources and local expert knowledge.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>C.3.iii. Link type</b>: We provide information on the nature of the individual consumer-resource interactions based on the consumer-resource node classifications and other information. The following “Link types” are recognized: Predation, Micropredation, Parasitic Castration, Pathogen Infection, Macroparasitism, Trophically Transmitted Parasitism, Concomitant Predation on Symbionts, Trophic Transmission, Predation on Free-living Non-feeding Parasite Stages, Detritivory, and Parasite Intraguild Trophic Interaction. Given the importance of link types, we have pulled this information from the metadata link variable table and placed it in <a href="Table3C.htm">Table 3C</a>, which provides definitions of all link types. Understanding link types is essential prior to conducting analyses of the network. For instance, links defined as Predation involve predators as consumers, whereas links defined as Parasitic Castration involve parasitic castrators as consumers. Also, several of the link types that are not typically included in food webs do not represent resource dependencies (i.e., Concomitant Predation on Symbionts, Trophic Transmission). For this reason, such links should be excluded from some analyses. However, Concomitant Predation on Symbionts represents mortality sources for symbionts, and Trophic Transmission is important to understand parasite transmission.
		</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>
		<b>D.1. General note</b>: As with all ecological networks there is uncertainty in link assignment and in the inclusion or omission of some nodes in this food web and we welcome any input from colleagues facilitating augmentation or improvement of the web. Along these lines, we will periodically update the dataset (please check for <a href="Table1.htm">the latest update</a> before using the dataset).
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>D.2. Nodes</b>: The primary shortcoming of the data set is the absence and under-representation of certain groups and the severe aggregation of many nodes. <a href="Table4.htm">Table 4</a> details the missing and under-represented groups as well as the extent of aggregation of various assemblages. Ectoparasites of birds and fishes are largely absent from the dataset.  Parasites and micropredators of seagrass and algae are also poorly incorporated into the dataset. Saprophytic fungi and other members of the detrital community are greatly overlooked here.  Finally, including microfauna such as protists (both symbiotic and free-living), bacteria and viruses to an extent that accurately reflects their importance to the system will likely require an effort exceeding that required to assemble the current web.
	</p>
	<p>
		While most nodes, particularly macroinvertebrates, have been resolved to species (or lifecycle stages of species) some nodes represent aggregated species assemblages. Meiofaunal groups are both severely aggregated and also under-represented, this includes the smallest free-living metazoans (e.g., gnathostomulids, and kinorhynchs). Nematodes and epipelic flora are other speciose assemblages that have been aggregated, the latter of which though, is mostly composed of benthic diatoms lacking feeding links and likely sharing consumer links.
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>D.3. Links</b>: By supplementing direct observation of links with expert opinion and literature sources we believe we have provided a relatively comprehensive view of the trophic interactions in the system.  If future study is able to decompose aggregated assemblages into their component species the respective trophic interactions will have to be modified with equal care. Additionally, future study might wish to explicitly identify non-substitutable resources for various consumers.
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>D.4. Potential enhancements</b>: Beyond addressing the inclusion and resolution of the nodes outlined above, future studies can make valuable contributions to the dataset by quantifying the abundance, body size and biomass of the nodes present in this system. This is would be a valuable next step and would aid in determining how infectious agents compare with free-living organisms.
