          Parasitic Protists
        </td>
        <td>
          Though some single-celled parasitic organisms are in the web, most were not included. For example, fish blood was not examined for hemoflagellates.

          This node is an aggregate of the belowground biomass of all terrestrial plant material. Though not included in any link file, because it has no trophic links, this node does have a biomass and is included in the nodes data.
