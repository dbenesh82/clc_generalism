		<b>E. Abstract</b>: This data set presents a food web for the Sylt tidal basin, an intertidal ecosystem in Germany and Denmark.  The intertidal part of this bight consists of extensive tidal flats with the main habitats being lugworm sandflats, seagrass meadows, and mixed mussel and oyster beds.  This food web has three noteworthy attributes: (1) high resolution of free-living organisms, (2) inclusion of metazoan parasites and other infectious agents, and (3) inclusion of ontogenetic stages of parasites with complex life cycles.  The food web contains 230 nodes, 161 species/assemblages, and 3338 links.  Of the 161 species/assemblages, 6 are basal, 120 are free-living, and 35 are infectious.  Data on the free-living assemblages and parisitism were gathered during original field sampling and supplemented with information from additional published sources and local expert knowledge.  Taxonomic resolution is high, although a few functional or taxonomic groups (e.g., phytoplankton, macroalgae) are lumped into single nodes.  Each ontogenetic stage of parasites with complex life cycles is treated separately and coded accordingly.  For each node, we have included additional information such as taxonomy, life history, residency, and vagility.  Further, for each link, we define a specific interaction type.  We present the data and metadata in the system-neutral format standardized by R.F. Hechinger and colleagues, and thus we recognize variables that are not represented in our data set but may be added by further study.

      <b>A. Overall project description</b>:  Not applicable, as this is a stand-alone project.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>B. Research motivation</b>: Recent studies examining the ecological role of parasites (Lafferty et al. 2008) have found that parasites can dramatically influence properties such as food web structure (Lafferty et al. 2006<i>a</i>, Lafferty et al. 2006<i>b</i>) and ecosystem energetics (Kuris et al. 2008). Here, we provide full data on the intertidal food web of Sylt tidal basin, in Germany/Denmark. This data set was compiled as part of a postdoctoral research project to investigate the role of parasites in food webs. The food web of free-living species is based on long-term research data from the area spanning over several decades and expands on an earlier web from the same basin, solely concerned with energy flow (Baird et al. 2004). Knowledge of parasites in this area dates back several decades (Thieltges et al. 2008) and was complemented by recent extensive studies during 2001&ndash;2006    </p>

		<b>C.1 System definition</b>
	</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>
			<b>C.1.i Description</b>:  The Sylt tidal basin, also called Sylt-Rømø Bight, is located in the northern Wadden Sea (North Sea, Germany/Denmark) and is enclosed by the islands of Sylt and Rømø, two causeways to the islands and by the mainland. The total tidal basin covers 407 km2 and has a tidal range of approximately 1.8 m. The intertidal area accounts for 33% of the total basin area and is composed of 72% sand, 25% mixed, and 3% mudflats. The main habitats are lugworm sandflats (66%), seagrass meadows (12%), and mixed mussel and oyster beds (3%). Over 2000 species (not including bacteria) from the basin have been described to date. Mean water temperature is 9 °C, (half year mean: 5 °C in winter and 15 °C in summer) and salinity remains close to the mean of 30 psu. For more information on the basin see Gätje and Reise (1998). The following is a map of the Sylt tidal basin:

		<b>C.2. Nodes</b>
	</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>
			<b>C.2.i. Orientation</b>: Nodes for the food web are listed in the Nodes data files. Two metadata tables describe the Nodes data files. <a href="Table2A.htm">Table 2A</a> defines node data column headers. <a href="Table2B.htm">Table 2B</a> defines node data column variables. Below, we provide additional background information on the nodes.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>C.2.ii. Node inclusion</b>: Node inclusion in the food web was determined as follows for free-living species and for parasites. From the more than 2000 known free-living species, only the most important ones in terms of abundance and biomass were included. We based the inclusion on long-term observations and sampling campaigns using original data, literature sources and local expert knowledge, thus expanding on an existing web from the basin that was solely concerned with the flow of energy (Baird et al. 2004). The inclusion of metazoan parasites in various host species in this system was based on original data, literature sources and local expert knowledge. Trophic interactions for free-living species as well as parasites were obtained from original data, literature sources and local expert knowledge.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>C.2.iii. Node resolution</b>: In general, taxonomic resolution is high, though some functional or taxonomic groups (e.g., phytoplankton, benthic diatoms, macroalgae) are aggregated into single nodes. The “Node Resolution” column in the node data files indicates the degree of resolution for each node, while the “Node Type” column is descriptive of the kind of resolution attributed to each node. Finally, as indicated by their discrete number codes and working names all nodes are mutually exclusive.
		</p>
		<p>
			In addition to providing a unique working name for each node, and indicating the general organismal “Group” to which each node belongs, the data sets also include a series of columns for the taxonomic hierarchy (i.e., Kingdom through Specific epithet). This is primarily to aid users in understanding node identity and to facilitate taxonomic diversity analyses, vs. the adoption of any particular taxonomic scheme.		</p>
		<p>
			<b>C.2.iv. Additional node classifications</b>: To facilitate analyses and interpretation, we have additionally classified nodes by several different schemes. The node metadata tables list and define all such categories and variables (Tables <a href="Table2A.htm">2A</a>, <a href="Table2B.htm">2B</a>). For example, we indicate each node’s “Feeding type” (feeding, non-feeding, autotrophic), “Lifestyle” (e.g., free-living, infectious, commensal), “Consumer Strategy” (e.g., predator, macroparasite, pathogen, detritivore), and “Native” or non-native status. Additionally, the columns “Mobility” and “Residency” indicate for each node the general degree of vagility characterizing individuals on daily and seasonal time scales.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>C.2.v. Node biomass estimation</b>: We do not estimate the biomass of each node.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>C.2.vi. Node body size estimation</b>: We do not estimate the body size of each node.
		</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>
		<b>C.3. Links</b>
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>C.3.i. Link orientation</b>: Consumer-resource links for the food web are listed in the links data files. Two metadata tables describe the links data files. <a href="Table3A.htm">Table 3A</a> defines all column headers. <a href="Table3B.htm">Table 3B</a> defines all column variables, except for the Link Types, which are indicated in <a href="Table3C.htm">Table 3C</a>. Below, we provide additional background information.
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>C.3.ii. Link determination</b>: Trophic interactions for free-living species as well as parasites were obtained during original field sampling and supplemented with literature sources and local expert knowledge.
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>C.3.iii. Link type</b>: We provide information on the nature of the individual consumer&#150;resource interactions based on the consumer&#150;resource node classifications and other information. The following “Link types” are recognized: Predation, Micropredation, Parasitic Castration, Pathogen Infection, Macroparasitism, Trophically Transmitted Parasitism, Concomitant Predation on Symbionts, Trophic Transmission, Predation on Free-living Non-feeding Parasite Stages, Detritivory, and Parasite Intraguild Trophic Interaction. Given the importance of link types, we have pulled this information from the metadata link variable table and placed it in <a href="Table3C.htm">Table 3C</a>, which provides definitions of all link types. Understanding link types is essential prior to conducting analyses of the network. For instance, links defined as Predation involve predators as consumers, whereas links defined as Parasitic Castration involve parasitic castrators as consumers. Also, several of the link types that are not typically included in food webs do not represent resource dependencies (i.e., Concomitant Predation on Symbionts, Trophic Transmission). For this reason, such links should be excluded from some analyses. However, Concomitant Predation on Symbionts represents mortality sources for symbionts, and Trophic Transmission is important to understand parasite transmission.	</p>
	<p>
		<b>D. Data limitations and potential enhancements</b>
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>D.1. General note</b>: As with all ecological networks there is uncertainty in link assignment and in the inclusion or omission of some nodes in this food web and we welcome any input from colleagues facilitating augmentation or improvement of the web. Along these lines, we will periodically update the dataset (please check for <a href="Table1.htm">the latest update</a> before using the data set).
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>D.2. Nodes</b>: The primary shortcoming of the data set is the absence and under-representation of certain groups and the severe aggregation of many nodes. <a href="Table4.htm">Table 4</a> details the missing and under-represented groups as well as the extent of aggregation of various assemblages. Ectoparasites of birds and fishes are largely absent from the dataset.  Parasites and micropredators of seagrass and algae are also poorly incorporated into the data set. Additionally, including microfauna such as protists (both symbiotic and free-living), bacteria and viruses to an extent that accurately reflects their importance to the system will likely require an effort which exceeds that required to assemble the current web.
	</p>
	<p>
		While most nodes have been resolved to species (or life cycle stages of species) some nodes represent aggregated species assemblages. Meiofaunal groups are both severely aggregated and under-represented, this includes the smallest free-living metazoans (e.g., gnathostomulids, kinorhynchs and nematodes). Epipelic flora is another aggregated but speciose assemblage, though it is mostly composed of benthic diatoms lacking feeding links and likely sharing consumer links.
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>D.3. Links</b>: By supplementing direct observation of links with expert opinion and literature sources we believe we have provided a relatively comprehensive view of the trophic interactions in the system.  If future study is able to decompose aggregated assemblages into their component species the respective trophic interactions will have to be modified with equal care. Additionally, future study might wish to explicitly identify non-substitutable resources for various consumers.
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>D.4. Potential enhancements</b>: Beyond addressing the inclusion and resolution of the nodes outlined above, future studies can make valuable contributions to the dataset by quantifying the abundance, body size and biomass of the nodes present in this system. This is would be a valuable next step and would aid in determining how infectious agents compare with free-living organisms.
