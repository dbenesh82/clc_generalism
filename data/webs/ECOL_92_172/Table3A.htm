          Link Type
        </td>
        <td>
          The unordered nominal definition of a trophic interaction corresponding to the Link Type ID column. Link types are mutually exclusive.  We use the term ‘symbiont’ after De Bary (1879), to refer to all mutuals, commensals and parasites for which a larger organism serves as the host to an intimate and durable interaction. We use 'host’ to refer to the resource individual for all trophic interactions where the consumer is a symbiont and by convention a micropredator. We use ‘prey’ to designate resource individuals when the consumer is not a symbiont or a micropredator.   Not all links are trophic (e.g. commensal) and care must be taken to exclude these from analyses of food web structure.

          The Node ID of the vector necessary for a parasitic feeding link to occur.  For instance, enter the Node ID for mosquito here if the link is malaria-human. If more than one vector can lead to this type of parasitism, there will be multiple rows repeated here, one for each prey type.  Note, in many cases, this will lead to duplicate links, which may need to be considered in analyses.
