          The ordinal Stage ID number within species. Adult lifecycle stages are designated as 1. The youngest lifecycle stage is then 2, next youngest 3, etc. Each number corresponds to a particular lifecycle stage that is consistent within a group but not between them (e.g. for trematodes 2 = parthenitae, but for dipterans 2 = larvae). Not all of a species' lifecycle stages are necessarily present a particular food web.

          A consumer individual blocks the reproduction of its individual host. Thus, while they reduce host fitness to zero, parasitic castrators do not kill their host and often do not reduce the ability of the host to survive. The effect on the host is intensity-independent, in that there is no additive reproductive effect of additional parasitic castrators on the host. Examples: digenean trematodes in first intermediate molluscan hosts, bopyrid isopods, rhizocephalan barnacles, most Strepsiptera.

The effects are intensity-independent, as the outcome may result from a single infectious agent (or inoculum). These consumers are appropriately modeled using microparasite models (Anderson and May, 1979). Examples: smallpox, diphtheria, malaria, lice, scale insects, Gyrodactylus spp.

          Facultative Micropredation
        </td>
        <td>
          The outcome of a feeding interaction of a facultative micropredator depends on the relative size of the prey or host individual. On a large host the consumer is a micropredator, but on a small prey the consumer is a predator. The relative sizes determining feeding outcomes are system specific (e.g. vampire bats, lampreys, fang blennies). Related terms used in system and taxon-specific contexts include browser, grazer and sublethal predator.
